<h3>
  ABOUT US
</h3>
<p>
UTokyo Plarailers is an engineering circle of the Univesity of Tokyo for the purpose of “Plarail” remodelling by equipping it with a microcomputer.
</p>
<p>
“Plarail” is a very popular toy train with a DC motor made by Tomy Company, Ltd. We have developed a remote control system using the Internet and are trying to construct an automatic control system.
To exhibit our system, we have participated in the school festivals of UTokyo, <strong>Gogatsusai (五月祭)</strong> and <strong>Komabasai (駒場祭)</strong> since 2019 and given many people opportunities to get in touch with engineering.
