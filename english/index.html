  ABOUT US
</h3>
<p>
Plarailers UTokyo is a engineering circle of the Univesity of Tokyo for the purpose of “Plarail”  remodelling by equipping it with a microcomputer .
</p>
<p>
“Plarail” is a very popular toy train with a DC motor mede by Tomy Company, Ltd. We have developed a remote control system using Internet and are trying to construct a automatic control system.
To exhibit our system, we have participated in the school festivals of UTokyo, <strong>Gogatsusai（五月祭）</strong>and <strong>Komabasai（駒場祭）</strong>since 2019 and give many people opportunities to get in touch with engineering.
