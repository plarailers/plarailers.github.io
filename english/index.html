Plarailers UTokyo is a engineering circle of the Univesity of Tokyo for the purpose of “Plarail”  remodelling by equipping it with a microcomputer .
“Plarail” is a very popular toy train with a DC motor mede by TAKARA-TOMY. We have developed a remote control system using Internet and are trying to construct a automatic control system.
We have participated in the school festivals of UTokyo, Gogatsusai（五月祭）and  Komabasai（駒場祭）since 2019 and give many people opportunities to get in touch with engineering.
